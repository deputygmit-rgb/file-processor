Then again we checked parameters and we found that voltage was very low in communication. So telecom staff tried to improve the voltage then voltage was improved. Reset was applied then system got resetted and after passing of train again system got failed. Error code was again 30. Then we replaced modem card. Same thing again happened. System was taking reset but it was failing to get clear after the passing of train. Meanwhile SMRs of ofc hut got damaged due to AC voltage fluctuations. So telecom staff brought  SMRs from Naghbir. Then they rectified their SMRs and battery. Then again we applied reset , reset was taken but again system was not getting clear. So we decided to replace entire unit with fresh unit. Unit was not available at NAB store, so it was brought from KEZ which took alot of time.

Detail log analysis by HRSTS engineer it was noticed that online MLK-II\ncard file A6 reset first at 20:51:59hrs with error \"online sync reset bit set by application logic\". Then after\nMLK-II cardfile B6 became work as online system. but at 20:52:074hrs card file B6 also reset with error\n\"out 16 board J6, output9-output failure during diagnostic test\". Both card file (i.e. A6 & B6) of some\nmicrolok system C6 were unavailale at aprox same time, resulting communication break between MLKII system C6 to all other associate microlok cardfile and tital EI system became down, also CCIP &\nVDU became inoperative. Based on investigation HRSTS first check the connectivity between\ncommunication switch to ECB PCB (LAN connection), also check LAN cable phyical condition, RJ-45\nconnection. PING test done of both IP from maintainenace PC of central EI room found in well\ncondition. Later also check all terminal voltages for B6 cardfile. Measuring voltages of B6 cardfile are\nunder given. M6J2-2 & M8K2-2 (fuse terminal & negative terminal) got voltage25.8vdc. This voltage\nthrough from this terminal to M6B6 VCOR contact 7A & 7B. When VCOR picked up ten voltage through\nfrom 8A & 8B to M6 J4-1 terminal. On M6 J4-1 terminal measured voltages was 25.6vdc. From M6J4-1\nterminal to M6J4-2 to 6 terminal voltage gone through looping with comb link. Also measured terminal\nvoltages got 25.5vdc.

The actual cause of the failure was the accumulation of dust of ballast mixed with oil after the block of open BT (14:30 to 15:30 on 10.02.25)  which obstructed the point, the issue was addressed by clearing the obstruction and re-oiling the point. The failure occurred at point 43B, which only failed in reverse, causing a delay. However, this did not affect the main line trains movement because point 43 was set in normal. At 23:52, the SISB train arrived on line number 2, followed by NMG/BSL, which was scheduled to be dispatched from line number 1. Due to the point not being set in reverse, NMG/BSL had to be kept on line number 1. The SISB train departed at 00:07, and SHIVNATH Express passed through line number 2 at 00:14, followed by subsequent trains on the same line.The failure was attended  after the 12950 train passed at 00:37 from line no 1, and the issue was rectified by 00:50hrs and NMG/BSL departed from line no 1 at 00:57hrs.

      "As per gate man diary entry number 55 of TMR station during closing of gate the up side boom of LC-532 was stuck and become inoperative because the on duty gate man gives multiple commands of open and close during closing, causing it to stuck than on duty gate man operated gate using crank handle still gate indication not obtained than operated sliding barrier still gate close and lock indication of gate is not obtained. Later S&T staff attended and found that the crank handle key is kept out and not insert back to EKT after crank handle operation by on duty gateman due to which the gate close and lock indication was not obtained. S&T staff inserted the crank handle key in respective EKT and gate close and lock indication obtained and failure rectified at 15:21hrs. After that S&T staff operated gate multiple times no fault found and gate is working properly. It is evident from the findings that the incident was caused solely by the improper operation of the gate by the on-duty gateman, including failing to reinsert the crank handle key into the EKT after manual operation. This operational error directly led to the gate's malfunction and the resulting train detention.",

ESM/BMP got failure information at 11:00 hrs. He reached at site at 11:10 hrs. then, Step by step each and every relay was checked with   the help of ARC staff. ASGNCR, SHKR relay was checked, then cancel-cooperation relay wiring and voltage was checked but No Fault found after JE/NAB Mr. Raunak reached at site at 12:40 hrs. at BMP. Then, after checking Flat cable of the UFSBI mux was interchanged. Then UFSBI started normal working. After pressing TGT button and then the cancel-cooperation button pressed the block panel failed. Then restarted the system and the system was working normally. But the system was failing only because of pressing the cancel cooperation button. This was happening because of co-operation button miniature relay was defective. It was faulty. The same was replaced and the failure was rectified at 13:26 hrs.
